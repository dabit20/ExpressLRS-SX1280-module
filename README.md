# ExpressLRS SX1280-based Rx/Tx module

This module is a first shot at creating a suitable platform for a 2.4GHz port of the [ExpressLRS](https://github.com/AlessandroAU/ExpressLRS) radio link system for model aircraft.
It is based on the 20x20 M2 flight stack form factor and it uses the Chengdu EByte E28 modules, which are available in +12dBm, +20dBm and +27dBm output power. All these modules should work

This PCB can be used in the JR bay as the TX module, and on the quadcopter (or other RC aircraft) as RX module. Check the ExpressLRS project for more details. 

The board has not been tested yet. Beware.

Design was done in KiCAD 5.1 
Production files, PDF and artist impressions are available in the production_data/ directory
